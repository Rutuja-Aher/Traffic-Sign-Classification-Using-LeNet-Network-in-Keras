## Overview

This repository contains a deep learning project that focuses on classifying traffic signs using the LeNet convolutional neural network implemented in Keras. Traffic sign recognition is a crucial component of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This project aims to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify traffic signs from images.

## Dataset

Explain the dataset used for this project. Provide details about the number of classes, images, and any preprocessing that was done.

We used the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) dataset, which contains 43 different classes of traffic signs and over 50,000 images for training and testing.

## Installation

Specify the steps to set up the project on a local machine. This may include instructions on how to create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and download the dataset.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-classification.git
cd traffic-sign-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the project. Include code snippets and examples to demonstrate how to run the code.

```python
python classify_traffic_sign.py --image image.jpg
```

## Model Architecture

Explain the architecture of the LeNet model used for traffic sign classification. You can include a summary, visual representation, or even code snippets.

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (5, 5), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (5, 5), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(120, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(84, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
```

## Training

Explain how to train the model. Include information about hyperparameters, data augmentation, and training duration.

```python
python train_traffic_sign_model.py
```

## Evaluation

Provide information on how to evaluate the model's performance and metrics used for evaluation. You can also present example results with images.

```python
python evaluate_traffic_sign_model.py
```

## Results

Discuss the results and performance of the model. Mention accuracy, precision, recall, and any limitations. You can also include visualizations of the model's predictions.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to the project, including guidelines for submitting issues and pull requests.

## License
